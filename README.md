# Stitch AI

> Decentralized Knowledge Hub for AI
> 

## Overview

Stitch AI enables sovereign, interoperable memory for AI models/agents through [RAG](https://www.notion.so/RAG-c206dc99435d494bae5eb0fa3f29158c?pvs=21) and blockchain. We provide **the critical post-training knowledge layer** - live data, domain expertise, and human interactions **that LLMs never learned during pre-training**.

## Why Memory Matters

*"Agents without memory are workers frozen in time"*

**The AI Memory Crisis**:

- **Static Knowledge Problem**:
    - Models are trapped with outdated training data
    - Missing critical real-time information and updates
- **Cost Inefficiency Problem**:
    - Knowledge resets between every session
    - Limited by maximum token window size
- **Platform Lock-in Problem**:
    - No standardized memory format between platforms
    - Unable to share knowledge across different frameworks
- **Data Readiness Problem**:
    - 80% of data locked in unstructured formats
    - Complex documents and data structures resist LLM integration

    - One memory format for all platforms
- **Living Knowledge Graph**:
    - Continuous learning from agent interactions
    - Real-time updates from community

## Key Components

### Agent Memory

- **The Building Blocks of AI Memory**
    - Sovereign memory modules that retain ownership of AI Agent’s interactions
    - Platform-agnostic design (ChatGPT ↔ Virtual Protocol ↔ Zerepy)
    - Monetize from the AI Agent’s memory

### Shared Memory

- **Collective and Evolving Intelligence Pool for Domain Memory Boilerplate**
    - Baseline knowledge formed with selective Fabric Memories
    - Community-driven updates via $MEM token rewards
    - Continuously enhanced by agent/model contributions
    - Categories:
        - Financial Agent
        - Social Channel Agent
        - Game Agent

### Memory Marketplace

- **Knowledge Economy Engine**
    - Trade domain expertise as encrypted NFTs
    - Monetize agent training patterns
    - Safely exchange proprietary data (raw content never exposed)

### Node Network

- **Decentralized Backbone**
    - Incentivized storage of high-demand memories
    - On-chain validation of RAG relevance through multiple benchmarks
    - Ensures data availability and system scalability

## Vision

Stitch AI envisions a future where artificial general intelligence emerges organically through a decentralized knowledge base built from the collective experiences of thousands of AI agents. Unlike traditional AGI approaches that rely on singular, centralized models, our knowledge base grows through real-world interactions and learnings of diverse agents, each shaped by their operator's unique characteristics, expertise, and background.

Through our Memory Marketplace and collaborative infrastructure, we're creating the foundation for AGI by enabling agents to share, trade, and build upon each other's experiences, making artificial intelligence development more inclusive, diverse, and representative of humanity as a whole.
